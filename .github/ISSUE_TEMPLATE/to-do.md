For information on how to create a task list (aka to-do list), see here:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#task-lists

To do:
1. [ ] Please specify the file that needs changing, the properties, methods, or algorithms that need adjustment, and the line or block of code (range of lines), if possible. Suggest some pseudo-code or reference any documents or resources that might help, including MATLAB documentation. No need for the pseudo-code to be refined but the more specific, the better.
