<h1>Masking Tool</h1>

<p>The masking tool allows for manual refinement of the segmentation mask after initial segmentation has been performed by the segmentation GUI.
The masking tool can also stand alone and be launched from the command line if the user would like to edit a mask from the workspace.
<ul>
	<li>A painting tool, <b>"Turbo Paint Brush"</b>, which allows the user to create mouse strokes to select regions they want to mask. The radius of the brush can be adjusted</li>
	<li>A freehand selection tool, <b>"Bounding Curves"</b>, which allows the user to mask a bounded region.</li>
	<li>A smart masking tool, <b>"Seed Region"</b>, which finds pixels similar to the one selected by the user upon clicking based off of a user defined tolerance.
	<li>A point selection tool, <b>"Point"</b>, which appends a single pixel to the mask.</li>
	<li>A single ROI appending tool, <b>"Touch Up"</b>, which appends a circular ROI to the mask. The radius can be adjusted. </li>
	<li><b>Close interior</b> will close the inside of the region last drawn via the Turbo Paint Brush method.</li>
	<li><b>Close all</b> will close the inside of the entire mask regardless of how it was drawn. Note that this method and the method above involve a convex hull.</li>
</ul>
